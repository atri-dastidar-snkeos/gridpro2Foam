GridPro2FOAM converter


1.) periodic patches
periodic surfaces are automatically converted to cyclic patches

2.) cyclic patches
the cyclic patch needs to be defined as an internal surface. By default the internal surfaces are treated as
standard block connectivities. However, by specifying the option --cyclic <surface number> at the end of the command line,
the internal surface will be treated as a cyclic patch.
